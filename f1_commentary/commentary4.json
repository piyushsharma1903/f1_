{"race_id": "1123779", "commentary": "It's a case of what might have been for McLaren; Piastri after losing out at the start had got back ahead of Leclerc when the race restarted, but then lost out again due to the timing of his pitstop under green coming one lap before race control threw a safety car for the mass of debris on the straight."},

{"race_id": "1123430", "commentary": "An incident in the pitlane though fortunately not involving any cars. The mechanic that instructs Leclerc to leave his garage loses his footing while running backwards and executes a perfect reverse roll. Funny when it's not serious but thankfully he's ok."},
{"race_id": "1123430", "commentary": "A lot of drivers are struggling with grip in the stadium section - Hulkenberg locks-up at the hairpin now. Not the first and won't be the last."},
{"race_id": "1123430", "commentary": "Just over halfway through the session and there's a small lull with some cars in the pits, but Stroll is about to pump a lap in on softs. It's not a great lap from the Canadian though - he goes only 12th."},
{"race_id": "1123430", "commentary": "The Alpines are really struggling for pace this weekend after a positive result last weekend for Gasly. The two drivers are 18th and 19th so far, albeit on medium tyres, but still slower than even Bottas in the Sauber."},

{"race_id": "1123430", "commentary": "Sainz is in fine form... another improvement and he goes fastest with a 1m17.447s. Quite astonishingly, he didn't set a personal best sector during that lap."},
{"race_id": "1123430", "commentary": "Leclerc has gone again and set a fastest final sector to stretch his advantage with a 1m17.616s. Meanwhile, Norris has gone wide with a snap of oversteer entering the Esses at T7. That could have been a whole lot worse for the McLaren driver."},
{"race_id": "1123430", "commentary": "Hulkenberg goes sixth for Haas on a set of mediums, ahead of both Red Bulls and Piastri as it stands. Perez is seventh after his first lap and whilst faster than Verstappen, his team-mate set his lap earlier on."},

{"race_id": "1123403", "commentary": "Earlier Zhou also mentioned he could smell burning. That burning he is describing is likely coming from his brake cooling being too marginal right now for Sauber - the lack of oxygen in the thin air here means the brakes just won’t work properly without added cooling and unlike engine maps that can be set to produce less power around the overheating common here, the brakes just get so stressed lap after lap."},

{"race_id": "1122969", "commentary": "There are improvements everywhere you look at the moment. Now Russell goes top for Mercedes with a 1m20.706s, notably on the mediums.

{"race_id": "1122349", "commentary": "After its cars were the first to put on the softs and briefly surged up the order, Williams has regressed to occupying 19th and 20th positions with Albon ahead of Sargeant. They are 1.5s and 1.8s respectively down on Hamilton's benchmark time, with the rest of the field covered by 1.1s. Work to do then, back at Grove."},
{"race_id": "1122349", "commentary": "It appears somewhat unlikely that we will see more laptime improvements in this session, as those cars that are running on softs it seems are doing so with more fuel on-board judging by times that are multiple seconds down on what they were doing earlier."},
{"race_id": "1122349", "commentary": "Despite sitting out FP1 earlier to give Oliver Bearman his latest rookie running, Nico Hulkenberg is right on the pace of Haas team-mate Kevin Magnussen. The two are line astern in P11 and P12, just 0.032s apart."},

{"race_id": "1122349", "commentary": "Where did that come from Pierre Gasly? The Alpine drive barges his way into fourth, 0.179s down on Hamilton, to push Verstappen back into fifth. That wasn't in the script, was it?"},
{"race_id": "1122349", "commentary": "Now Hamilton goes fastest, with a 1m13.264s to go 0.22s quicker than Sainz. In a flurry of improvements, Piastri went sixth after ditching the hards to go just ahead of Russell, who topped the early going on the mediums but wasn't as effective as Hamilton on their first soft runs."},
{"race_id": "1122349", "commentary": "Zhou meanwhile is raging at Tsunoda, who he feels blocked him through the high-speed final sector. How good is it by the way to have that back again after the tedious slow-speed chicane that for many years blighted the end of the lap here?"},
{"race_id": "1122349", "commentary": "Still, he's much closer to the summit than Stroll, who is over a second down on his first run with the softs. Alonso does go quicker than his team-mate, but it's only good enough for P11 for the other home race hero in the Aston Martin."},
{"race_id": "1122349", "commentary": "There's just 0.033s between Sainz and his former team-mate Norris at the head of the timesheets, but Verstappen can't match either and falls 0.218s behind in third."},

{"race_id": "1122349", "commentary": "Now Sainz makes his bid for the top spot and snatches it from Russell's earlier medium gambit. A 1m13.286s is the best time of the session so far as teams enter quali sim mode."},

{"race_id": "1122349", "commentary": "A 1m15.070s from Sargeant answers that question - a roughly 1.7s gain from the hard to the soft puts him P7 for now. What will those switching from the medium to soft manage to achieve? Norris and both Ferraris will soon give us an answer."},
{"race_id": "1122349", "commentary": "Sargeant is the first driver in the session to switch onto the soft tyre. Let's see what sort of laptime gain it will be worth over his current 1m16.748s best."},
{"race_id": "1122349", "commentary": "All cars are currently in the pits as set-up adjustments are carried out. Piastri is notable in P8 at the moment as his time was of course set on the hard tyres, relative to all around him on the medium.

{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "Ultimately, that was a qualifying session that promised much but had a familiar feel to it when the final segment came around. But Leclerc will be bitterly disappointed to only be fifth at a venue where Ferrari had looked so strong all weekend in practice."},
{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "Just in case you were wondering, that glut of drivers under investigation by the stewards for not following the minimum delta time have escaped sanction."},
{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "And we've got that rare sight of Stroll outqualifying Alonso! But they will be disappointed to both be behind Tsunoda's RB."},
{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "So, for all of the apparent Red Bull struggles, Verstappen does it again! The champion delivers when it matters, while Sainz comprehensively outperforms his team-mate on his return to the Ferrari."},
{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "Leclerc, meanwhile, aborts his lap and Norris therefore bumps the second Ferrari down to fifth."},
{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "And sure enough it's too good for his rivals. Sainz ends up two tenths adrift in second, while Perez is another tenth back in third."},
{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "Verstappen dips into the 1m15s! It's a 1m15.915s that will be tough to beat!"},
{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "All of the top six are improving on their latest laps - but that ominously includes Verstappen!"},
{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "There was a big slide at Turn 9 for Stroll on that lap, though - so it was far from ideal for the Canadian."},
{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "Stroll goes eighth with his first effort having opted for a single run here."},
{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "The fastest sectors are split between Verstappen, Perez and Sainz - so this does still remain an open battle. Remember how tricky these soft tyres are to preserve around a full tour of the Albert Park track."},
{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "So, everyone is back in the pits now. One more chance for someone to dethrone Verstappen. But three tenths is quite a chunk of time to find..."},
{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "Perez goes fourth with his first effort, while Norris heads the McLarens in fifth and sixth."},
{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "Alonso has aborted his lap after going off at Turn 6 - he had a major slide mid-corner and skated through the gravel. Not what the Aston driver wanted to start his Q3."},
{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "But here comes Verstappen! Bang! 1m16.048s and suddenly he's three tenths clear of the rest."},

{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "So, Sainz is the first to set a benchmark and it's a 1m16.331s for the Ferrari driver. Russell is half a second back."},

{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "So, eliminated in Q3 are Hamilton, Albon, Bottas, Magnussen and Ocon. Tsunoda is the interloper outside of the big five teams joining the Q3 ranks."},
{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "Leclerc goes second right at the end, but the big story is Hamilton failing to make his way through."},
{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "Hamilton is out, he's pitted and so Tsunoda has really rubbed salt into Ricciardo's wounds here."},

{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "So, with just over a minute to go, it's Albon, Tsunoda, Magnussen, Bottas and Ocon that are in danger of being eliminated here."},
{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "Alonso improves to seventh with his latest lap, six tenths off Sainz's benchmark."},
{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "That's some lap from Sainz as Leclerc can get nowhere near it - he only improves to third, four tenths adrift, with his next effort."},
{"race_id": "1121633", "commentary": "The answer is yes! He's two tenths quicker than Verstappen with a 1m16.189s."},

{"race_id": "1121629", "commentary": "More and more drivers are fitting softs now. Alonso goes again on the same set and this time hooks the lap together, although without any purple sectors. But the combination of personal bests puts him top with a 1m17.912s - 0.024 clear of Leclerc."},

Five stops for the Mexican in total."},

{"race_id": "1118109", "commentary": "A tactical decision, it appears, was behind Leclerc's decision not to head out for a second Q3 run.

{"race_id": "1118109", "commentary": "Ocon too you expect will be chuffed with ninth. Alpine may face a fight to stay at the head of the midfield bunch given Aston's form, but the incumbent has kept the French cars at the sharp end. A disappointing day for Gasly meanwhile means the Alpine newcomer will start last."},
{"race_id": "1118109", "commentary": "Although Hulkenberg lost his best lap for a track limits breach, it didn't cost him a position as his best effort was still slower than Ocon in ninth. A grand effort all the same from the German, who starts seven places ahead of his team-mate."},
{"race_id": "1118109", "commentary": "Aston will be heartened by making Q3 with both cars, although Alonso's deficit to pole ended up at a yawning 0.628s after topping FP2 and FP3. That just goes to show that practice is practice, and qualifying is an entirely different ball game."},

{"race_id": "1118053", "commentary": "Still, probably not as unusual as Narain Karthikeyan returning to F1 in 2011 with HRT after racing NASCAR Trucks the previous year. George Follmer arriving in F1 from Can-Am is another out-there example. Any more for any more?"},

{"race_id": "1118053", "commentary": "The fastest third sector time remains Sainz's from the morning session.

{"race_id": "1118053", "commentary": "Max Verstappen remains on top, where he has been since a little before the end of the morning session. His neck is showing no signs of giving up as he begins his 135th lap of the day, and he's currently lapping in the high 1m35s."},
{"race_id": "1118053", "commentary": "Here we go then, the sun has gone down and we're fully under the floodlights for the final hour and a bit of day one. Will anybody turn up the wick for a headline-grabbing glory run?"},

{"race_id": "1117307", "commentary": "Some of the teams are now packing up for the day, including down at Aston Martin, where Vettel's car is in many pieces ready for the end of the day. With the sun setting, it could be a metaphor for the whole F1 season."},

{"race_id": "1117307", "commentary": "For those still following, there's just eight cars out on track now with 20 minutes to go: Bottas, Ricciardo, Sainz, Schumacher, Russell, Zhou, Stroll and Latifi.

{"race_id": "1117307", "commentary": "Right, let's have a rundown of the order now we've got half an hour of this session remaining. Leclerc, Bottas and Ricciardo lead the way - but have used 2022 rubber - and then it's Sainz, Schumacher and Norris on the 2023 test rubber. Currently, there's very few green sector times being set so any changes to that top six appear unlikely right now."},

The fastest driver on the 2023 Pirellis is Sainz, 1.4s behind Leclerc, but the next quickest is Schumacher - some 2.7s adrift of the Ferrari pacesetter. All this suggests it's a harder compound of rubber being used here, we hope."},

{"race_id": "1117307", "commentary": "Sainz has now gone to the top of the times on the mystery tyres, just 0.093s faster than Leclerc's previous effort. Bottas is third, Hamilton fourth, from Ricciardo and Verstappen."},
{"race_id": "1117307", "commentary": "Just for reference, we do know what tyre Leclerc has used for his run, it's the soft. He's able to use that because Ferrari put Shwartzman in the car in the earlier session, meaning the team is allowed to both 2022 and 2023 rubber in FP3."},

{"race_id": "1115606", "commentary": "That moment aside, it has been an encouraging session for Mercedes. Hamilton was second in the overall times to Sainz and had been on par with the Ferrari lap times on the medium tyres, too. Three teams in the fight for pole, anyone?"},
{"race_id": "1115606", "commentary": "There was something vaguely dramatic for Hamilton at the end of the session, though, as he reports: \"Something might've fallen off the car at Turn 9.\" And there is indeed a chunk of bodywork that has been dislodged through Copse."},
{"race_id": "1115606", "commentary": "And we've now got the chequered flag. It may not have been the most dramatic of sessions but at least we had plenty of running and some intriguing times."},

{"race_id": "1115606", "commentary": "Sure enough, that lack of grip is evidenced by Russell locking up and failing to make the corner at Village."},
{"race_id": "1115606", "commentary": "Russell is told \"no need to manage, you can push it hard\", but the eighth-placed Mercedes driver responds saying \"no grip\". Russell is currently 0.7s slower than his team-mate."},
{"race_id": "1115606", "commentary": "We're normally into long-run territory at this stage of FP2, but we've got eight cars in the pits as the early weather disruption has put teams's plans up in the air."},

{"race_id": "1115606", "commentary": "Gasly has arrived at Silverstone with his 2023 future resolved, but it's not giving him any extra pace as he's down in 18th, the best part of a second slower than team-mate Tsunoda."},

{"race_id": "1107274", "commentary": "Replays show Giovinazzi lost it in exactly the same place as Leclerc did earlier, off the exit kerb at Turn 9, and backed the car hard into the wall - ripping open the TecPro barriers that have spilled their foam innards like a battle-scarred teddy onto the run-off area."},
{"race_id": "1107274", "commentary": "The session has been red-flagged, with the Alfa parked on the side of the track after a rearward impact that has disintegrated his rear wing."},

{"race_id": "1107274", "commentary": "Interestingly, it's Alonso who has the best final sector time - which suggests he did the better job of keeping his rubber alive into the segment of fiddly 90-degree corners, but was hampered by the Alpine's lack of aero bite around the faster sweeps at the start of the lap."},

{"race_id": "709698", "commentary": "His thunder is stolen though by Verstappen, who turns up the wick with a 1m30.847s. Bottas improved his time, but only to fifth on a 1m31.218s."},

{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Is this an on-track dust-up? Raikkonen and Sainz came together at Turn 10 there, as Sainz was on a lap, and it seems that the Spanish driver was most displeased. His disappointment was immeasurable, and his day was ruined."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "And that's it for pre-season testing! Verstappen top, Tsunoda 0.093s behind him, with Sainz third. Now...breathe."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Five minutes remain."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Hamilton has a tilt at a lap, but it's not phenomenal. But that's very Mercedes-like to keep a lid on the squid."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "I think this might be it for quick runs, as everyone's coming in and out of the pits on each lap. But I'm willing to be proven wrong..."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Red Bull's bringing Verstappen in to practice some pitstops, and the other teams seem to be following suit."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Verstappen's having another go, but finds the #9 Haas in his path at Turn 1 and immediately loses time."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "So, we've just over quarter of an hour left. Any last flyers?"},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Sainz goes up to P3, with a 1m29.611s."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "It's ol' Spinny Hamilton again, dabbing the accelerator just a little too roughly at the final corner and doing a 360 turn. He's back up and running, but was arguably going too slowly..."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "We won't see any more from Aston Martin today - Vettel's suffered a loss of turbo boost pressure. So, test over for the green team."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "The big difference between Verstappen and Tsunoda is the second sector - the Red Bull driver has quarter of a second over the AlphaTauri."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Tsunoda does get closer to him, though, putting in a 1m29.053s on the C5."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "It's a 1m28.960s for the Dutchman - displacing Tsunoda from the top of the timing boards. First man into the 1m28s, too - on the C4 tyres."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Verstappen might be about to end Tsunoda's reign here..."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "It's a 1m30.697s for Sainz, going P11."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Russell does a 1m30.399s to go P8, as Sainz also begins another go on C3 tyres."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Hamilton also posts another C5 time, posting a 1m30.025 to rise up to P4. Three-quarters of a second off Tsunoda."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "That was such a tidy final corner from Tsunoda, inch perfect on that final kerb."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Guess who goes even quicker? Tsunoda posts a 1m29.282s to find an extra 0.4s on his best..."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Ricciardo and Alonso are out on the road at the moment, as Tsunoda has been in and out of the pits."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "But Tsunoda wants top spot back - and he takes it with a 1m29.671s! To quote football commentator Ray Hudson, \"he's like Oliver Twist this boy, always wanting more - but he doesn't ask, he just takes it!\""},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Verstappen scorches to a 1m29.733s to return to the top, despite going off-line in sector 2! Big final sector for the Dutchman on the C3s - he can go faster, surely."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Russell sets a 1m30.600s, up to ninth place in that Williams."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Hamilton's done a 1m30.391s, his best lap so far. Still running relatively low power modes at the moment...just doing his thing."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "With the array of probes, you can build a pressure map, so you can determine where the vortices are, where the flow is headed, and correlate that with the pressure slices you get in CFD when you go through post-processing."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "\"Why do the teams run aero rigs and then flow-vis later on? Can't you get the same answer just by using the one and not the other?\" - not necessarily, because flow-vis gives you the flow patterns on the surface - but not how the airflow works around the car..."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "I'll field a couple of questions that we didn't answer earlier on the main Autosport account; \"why does the Haas look unstable in cornering\"? It's mainly because this is, effectively, a 2020 car with a 2021 floor. I guess they all are, but Haas has done very little development elsewhere, so it's basically just shed a bunch of downforce..."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Tsunoda had P1 for about two seconds, before Raikkonen went 0.011s faster."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "There is, as Raikkonen fires in a 1m29.766s to now go top!"},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Tsunoda quickest, with a 1m29.777s! There might, however, be a \"but\"..."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "The true battle, of course, is between Raikkonen and Russell. Russell on 140 laps, but Raikkonen's coming around to complete his 141st. It's purple so far, too..."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Into the final hour and it is our last changeover. Back from his Twitter Q&A, JBL will oversee the end of F1 pre-season testing."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Hamilton, on a second push lap after a cooldown, puts in a 1m30.643s to continue to chip away and move up to P8. Still some 0.8s off Verstappen's earlier effort."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Sainz is back in the Ferrari garage after his car appeared to be stuck in fourth gear when he trundled around before he pitted. The Ferrari mechanics are currently investigating."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Tsunoda goes for another push lap after a cooldown but is half a second slower this time as it appears his soft tyres cry enough."},
{"race_id": "538315", "commentary": "Moments later, Hamilton, also on a new set of C4s, climbs up to P10 with a 1m30.928s. Time to find for the Mercedes driver."},
